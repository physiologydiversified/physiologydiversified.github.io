    <h2>My Master's Research Project</h2>
    <p>For my MRP, I’m addressing the issue of outdated and poorly representative lecture diagrams in large undergraduate physiology courses, which are foundational for advanced medical science. Physiology lacks high-quality visual resources compared to general anatomy, making it harder to teach effectively. To solve this, I’m creating a free online database of modern, scientifically accurate diagrams that emphasize equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). The diagrams, ranging from static to interactive media, are prototyped in Figma and hosted on GitHub to provide students and educators with accessible, engaging learning tools.</p>
