            <p>I'm super excited to begin this course! I dabbled a bit in HTML/CSS as a beginner during undergrad, but I'm really happy to be learning about the fundamentals of web design in a formal manner. I found it really helpful to learn specifically about the three different ways to add CSS styles to an HTML doc - inline, internally, and externally. I'm looking forward to learning more about web design and how to make interactive elements for my MRP!</p>

            <p>I really enjoyed the walkthrough demo today in-class of how to go from a Figma wireframe to Github code. I found the demo of how to exactly setup the Figma wireframe to be very useful, including the exploration into Figma's Developer Mode tools. Excited to keep learning and experimenting with my own site and MRP prototype!</p>

            <p>This was a really fun deep dive into storyboarding as previsualization for linear media. The in-class activities were really fun and reverse-engineering animations made me exercise my brain in a new way! I really loved seeing the animatic for the Disney short "Bao" - super cute!!</p>

            <p>This was a great class, really enjoyed learning about accessible design. I found the guide to be very useful and will look to it as a resource for developing interactive media for the group project and MRP. </p>

            <p>Today, I learned about different forms of scrollytelly tools and important considerations. Our group pitched the idea of "Beanie's Backyard" for our interactive scrollytelly project. The media lab was a good exercise to look at the different forms that exist online, made for different audiences, and the pros and cons of this format. I think scrollytelly can be great for a linear narrative where the user is taken through a single journey from start to end, but maybe it's not so great for educational or didactic purposes where the reader needs to reference and go back to pieces of information in the story.</p>
